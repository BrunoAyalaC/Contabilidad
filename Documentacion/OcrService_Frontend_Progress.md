# OcrService Frontend Integration Progress

This document summarizes the current progress of the `OcrService` frontend integration.

## API Service (`src/api/ocr.ts`)

- A service file has been created to encapsulate API calls to the backend `OcrService` endpoints (`/invoices` for upload and status check).
- It assumes the backend `OcrService` is running on `http://localhost:5002`.

## User Interface (UI) Components

- **OCR Upload Page (`src/pages/OcrUpload.tsx`):**
    - Allows users to select and upload PDF files for OCR processing.
    - Displays the OCR job ID, status (Pending, Processing, Completed, Failed).
    - Polls the backend for job status updates.
    - Shows the parsed data (Invoice Number, Date, RUC, Total, Tax, etc.) upon completion.
    - Includes loading states and error messages.

## Routing

- `src/App.tsx` has been updated to include a new route:
    - `/ocr-upload`: For the OCR file upload and status display.
- A navigation link to the `OCR Upload` page has been added to the main navigation bar.
- This new route is protected by `PrivateRoute`, ensuring only authenticated users can access it.

## Next Steps

- **Backend Deployment:** Ensure the backend `OcrService` is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5002`.
- **Python Environment:** Ensure Python and `pdfplumber` are installed on the server where the `OcrService` backend runs.
- **Manual Testing:** Manually test the PDF upload, status tracking, and parsed data display functionality in the browser.
- **Integration with Register Invoice:** Integrate the parsed OCR data directly into the `RegisterInvoice` form of the `AccountingService` to pre-fill fields.
- **Advanced OCR Accuracy:** Explore more advanced OCR techniques or integrate with cloud-based OCR services for higher precision, as requested by the user.
